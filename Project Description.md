The objective of the projects are as follows:

1. **Machine Learning for Retail Sales Forecasting**
    Using machine learning regressor models we can predict future retail sales of the same. The dataset availability is not that much ease to get but there are some sample datasets given in the research paper and following that pattern I got some datasets in Kaggle. The project main model will be Decision Trees Regression.

2. **Production Fixed Horizon Planning**
    This is to get purchase order for customers from the result predicted by the Model in Retail Sales Forecasting. Then we will be using this data to minimize the total cost by optimizing several constraints related to the cost. To start with I will be learning about Wagner-Whitin method and implement here with python.

3. **Resources Planning and Scheduling**
    Now some production order planning is fixed now we must plan and schedule workforce and raw material without wasting any resources. To start with, I can use Linear Programming to find the right number of workers to hire.

4. **Supply Chain Network Optimization**
    Using above details, we can find the optimal allocation of factories and distribution centre to meet the demand of customers. This also involves linear programming model but if problem and challenge is there if the change in demand is changing and solution for that must be found.

5. **Warehouse Picking Productivity**
    In a distribution centre or factories, the travel time from one place to another through various routes can be optimized and it may also be solution for above stated problem. We can use an order batching, Spatial Clustering and Pathfinding algorithm to optimize the routes. This part will be more challenging than others as I may need to learn new libraries like SciPy the same can be used for the others too, and Google OR tools (Google Optimization Tools) for pathfinding algorithm.
